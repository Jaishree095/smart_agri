## 🔁 Projects Included

### 1. 🚜 Smart Agriculture
An IoT-based simulation to monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rainfall for automated irrigation using sensors.

- 📂 File: `smart_agri.py`
- 📈 Output: Logs stored in `sensor_data.csv`
- ✅ Logic: Turns irrigation ON only when soil is dry & there's no rainfall

### 2. 🗑️ Smart Waste Management
Automatically detects garbage bin fill levels and alerts collection vehicles.

- 📂 File: `smart_waste.py`
- 📊 Output: Logs to `bin_data.csv`
- 🚛 Sends alert when a bin is 80%+ full

### 3. 🚦 Smart Traffic Management
Real-time simulation of traffic data from intersections to dynamically control traffic signals.

- 📂 File: `smart_trafic.py`
- 📋 Output: Logs to `traffic_log.csv`
- ⚙️ Adjusts signal time based on vehicle density and count

### 4. 🏥 Smart Healthcare Monitoring
Monitors patient vitals such as heart rate, temperature, BP, and SpO₂. Automatically alerts on anomalies and simulates medicine dispensing.

- 📂 File: `smart_healthcare.py`
- 📑 Output: Logs to `patient_log.csv`
- 💊 Dispenses medicine if BP is high
